# space-parens

In a galaxy far, far, away lived the space-parens who battled over the immutable and mutable state.

- Immutability awakens
- space-parens collection
- inventory to build a rebel base

- solar systems oppressed so far 
- a loop to gradually oppress all the solar systems in the galaxy
- build an immutable battle station
- a coded language for secure communication (start with roman numberals, clacks, ceaser cypher, industrial cypher, etc)

- mutating to the dark side

- The darkstar exhaust port has mutated by the immutable rebels, oh no... boom!

Start with modeling the immutable rebels


Someone buys you jarjar binks for christmas, so you immediately dissassociate it from you collection onto ebay for 1 credit
